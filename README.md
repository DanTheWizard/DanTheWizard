👋 Hello, I’m @DanTheWizard (Daniel Palmik):
- I strive to keep my friends, family, and coworkers safe in the digital and real world.
- I am interested in, enjoy working and figuring out how technology works (and possibly reverse engineer it), creating scripts to make my life (and my family/friends/coworkers) easier, and being together with my friends working on a problem.
- I am currently learning the Google Cybersecurity program, web development (with HTML, PHP, CSS, SQL, etc.), and simple scripting languages (Python, Powershell, Batch, Bach, etc.) 
- What you should definitely know about me is that I love to learn and expand my skills in all directions.
  - If I don't know something and it needs to be done, I will take some time to research it and come up with a conclusion/solution.
