👋 Hello, I’m @DanTheWizard (Daniel Palmik):
- I strive to keep my friends, family, and coworkers safe in the digital and real world.
- I am interested in, enjoy working and figuring out how technology works (and possibly reverse engineer it), creating scripts to make my life (and my family/friends/coworkers) easier, and being together with my friends working on a problem.
- I am currently learning the Google Cybersecurity program, web development (with HTML, PHP, CSS, SQL, etc.), and simple scripting languages such as Python, Powershell, Batch, Bach, and javascript (without any help of plugins like WordPress)
- Cybersecurity is one of my side interests as the digital world is becoming a dangerous place, with hackers trying to steal data for money, or users creating their own AI for evil means. Soon the internet is going to be a large battleground with weapons growing on both sides. I want to be on the side that helps the people, including the elderly, who can not protect themselves and are more prone to human error to fall right into the bad actor's hands.
  - I am eager to work with my team to pinpoint and locate problems, create and test our patches, and keep everyone's data safe as if we are defending the castle.

- What you should definitely know about me is that I love to learn and expand my skills in all directions.
  - If I don't know something and it needs to be done, I will take some time to research it and come up with a conclusion/solution.
